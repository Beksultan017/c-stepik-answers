integers:{
1 - ques:
N squirrels found K nuts and decided to divide them equally. Determine how many nuts each squirrel will get

2 - ques
N squirrels found K nuts and decided to divide them equally. Determine how many nuts will remain after all the squirrels take an equal number of nuts.

3 - ques
Given a natural number, output its last digit.

4 - ques
A two-digit number is given. Print its first digit (the number of tens)

5 - ques
Given a non-negative integer N, determine the number of tens in it (the penultimate digit of the number). If there is no penultimate digit,
then we can assume that the number of tens is zero.

6- ques
An integer three-digit number is given. Find the sum of its digits.

7-ques
The input is given a natural number N. Print the next even number after it

8-ques
At some school, they decided to recruit three new math classes and equip the classrooms for them with new desks.
Two students can sit at each desk. The number of students in each of the three classes is known. Print the smallest number of desks that you need to purchase for them.
Each class sits in its own office.

9-ques
A pie in the dining room costs A rubles and B kopecks. Determine how many rubles and kopecks you need to pay for N pies.

10-ques
The electronic clock shows the time in the h:mm:ss format (from 0:00:00 to 23:59:59), that is,
the number of hours is recorded first, then a two-digit number of minutes is required, then a two-digit number of seconds is required.
The number of minutes and seconds, if necessary, are supplemented to a two-digit number by zeros.

N seconds have passed since the beginning of the day. Output what the clock will show.

11-ques
The values of two time points belonging to the same day are given: hours, minutes and seconds for each of the time points.
It is known that the second moment of time did not come before the first.
Determine how many seconds have passed between two points in time

12 ques
MKAD

The length of the Moscow Ring Road is 109 kilometers. 
Biker Vasya starts from the zero kilometer of the MKAD and travels at a speed of V kilometers per hour. At what point will it stop in T hours?

13-ques
A four-digit number is given. Determine whether its decimal notation is symmetric. If the number is symmetric, then output 1, otherwise output any other integer.
A number can have less than four digits, then you need to assume that its decimal notation is supplemented on the left with insignificant zeros.

if and else: questions.

1.Two integers are given. Print the value of the largest of them. If the numbers are equal, print any of them.


2.Two integers are given. The program should output one if the first number is greater than the second, two if the second is greater than the first, or zero if they are equal.


3.Three integers are given. Find the largest of them (the program should output exactly one integer). The largest in this problem is understood as a number that is not less than any other.


4.Given three natural numbers A, B, C. Determine if there is a triangle with such sides. If the triangle exists, output the string YES, otherwise output the string NO.
A triangle is three points that do not lie on the same straight line.


5.Three integers are given. Determine how many of them match. The program should output one of the numbers: 3 (if all match), 2 (if two match) or 0 (if all the numbers are different).


6.The chess rook moves horizontally or vertically. Given two different cells of the chessboard, determine whether the rook can get from the first cell to the second one in one move.


7.The chess king moves horizontally, vertically and diagonally, but only by 1 square. Given two different squares of the chessboard, determine whether the king can get from the first square to the second one in one move.


8.The chess bishop moves diagonally. Given two different cells of the chessboard, determine whether the bishop can get from the first cell to the second one in one move.


9.The chess queen moves diagonally, horizontally or vertically. Given two different cells of the chessboard, determine whether the queen can get from the first cell to the second one in one move.


10.The chess knight moves with the letter "G" — two squares vertically in any direction and one square horizontally, or vice versa. Given two different squares of the chessboard, determine whether the knight can get from the first square to the second one in one move.


11.The chocolate bar has the form of a rectangle divided into N × M slices. A chocolate bar can be broken once in a straight line into two parts. Determine whether it is possible to break off exactly K slices from the chocolate in this way.


12.Yasha swam in a pool measuring N ×M meters and was tired. At that moment, he discovered that he was at a distance of X meters from one of the long sides (not necessarily from the nearest one) and Y meters from one of the short sides. What is the minimum distance Yasha has to swim to get out of the pool on the side?


13.Three numbers are given. Arrange them in non-decreasing order.
